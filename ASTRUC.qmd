# Main data set import

## Question 1

We created a data folder to store the files.

## Question 2

[Here](https://github.com/JBA15/stars) is the URL to the repository containing the project on Github.

```{r}
#| message: false
here::i_am("stars.Rproj")
library(here)
library(vroom)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Question 3

Let's load the main data set.

```{r}
planets <- vroom(here("data", "all-planets.csv"),
                 na = "Unknown",
                 locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","),
                 col_types = cols(
                   Planet_key = col_double(),
                   planet = col_character(),
                   STAR_CODE = col_double(),
                   `relative mass` = col_double(),
                   `Relative Density` = col_double(),
                   `RADIUS (EARTH)` = col_double(),
                   `Type Of Terrain` = col_character(),
                   `Climate Type` = col_character()
                 ))
```

```{r}
if (nrow(planets) == 902 & ncol(planets) == 8) {
  print("The loading process went great!")
} else {
  print("The loading process did not go well!")
}
```
Moreover, we loaded the data in order to have numerical variables recognised as numerical variables.

## Question 4

```{r}
num_planets <- nrow(planets)
num_variables <- ncol(planets)


```


```{r}
planets_summary <- data.frame(
  Attribute = c("Number of planets", 
                "Number of variables"),
  Value = c(
    num_planets,
    num_variables
  )
)
knitr::kable(planets_summary, caption = "Check for the validity of the loading process for planets")

```

## Question 5

```{r}
planets_no_na <- planets |>
  drop_na(`relative mass`) |>
  drop_na(`Relative Density`)

ggplot(planets_no_na, aes(x = `Relative Density`, y = `relative mass`)) +
  geom_point()
```
